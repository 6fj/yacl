cryptographic primitive: threshold proxy re encryption, 
which is based on SM2 curve, SM3 hash function, SM4 symmetric encryption 
(the above national security algorithm is implemented by calling yacl) to implement KEM/DEM encryption system. 
This primitive can be applied to data security, data security authorization, distributed key management and other scenarios
